# house-price-estimation
This is a project to practice applying random forest onto a dataset. The objective is to train a random forest model so that we can enter a set of sample inputs (the properties of the house) and have the model predict the sale price of the house. The dataset to be used is [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
